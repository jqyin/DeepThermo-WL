/* Perform a ring allreduce on the data. The lengths of the data chunks passed
 * to this function must be the same across all MPI processes. The output
 * memory will be allocated and written into `output`.
 *
 * Assumes that all MPI processes are doing an allreduce of the same data,
 * with the same size.
 *
 * A ring allreduce is a bandwidth-optimal way to do an allreduce. To do the allreduce,
 * the nodes involved are arranged in a ring:
 *
 *                   .--0--.
 *                  /       \
 *                 3         1
 *                  \       /
 *                   *--2--*
 *
 *  Each node always sends to the next clockwise node in the ring, and receives
 *  from the previous one.
 *
 *  The allreduce is done in two parts: a scatter-reduce and an allgather. In
 *  the scatter reduce, a reduction is done, so that each node ends up with a
 *  chunk of the final output tensor which has contributions from all other
 *  nodes.  In the allgather, those chunks are distributed among all the nodes,
 *  so that all nodes have the entire output tensor.
 *
 *  Both of these operations are done by dividing the input tensor into N
 *  evenly sized chunks (where N is the number of nodes in the ring).
 *
 *  The scatter-reduce is done in N-1 steps. In the ith step, node j will send
 *  the (j - i)th chunk and receive the (j - i - 1)th chunk, adding it in to
 *  its existing data for that chunk. For example, in the first iteration with
 *  the ring depicted above, you will have the following transfers:
 *
 *      Segment 0:  Node 0 --> Node 1
 *      Segment 1:  Node 1 --> Node 2
 *      Segment 2:  Node 2 --> Node 3
 *      Segment 3:  Node 3 --> Node 0
 *
 *  In the second iteration, you'll have the following transfers:
 *
 *      Segment 0:  Node 1 --> Node 2
 *      Segment 1:  Node 2 --> Node 3
 *      Segment 2:  Node 3 --> Node 0
 *      Segment 3:  Node 0 --> Node 1
 *
 *  After this iteration, Node 2 has 3 of the four contributions to Segment 0.
 *  The last iteration has the following transfers:
 *
 *      Segment 0:  Node 2 --> Node 3
 *      Segment 1:  Node 3 --> Node 0
 *      Segment 2:  Node 0 --> Node 1
 *      Segment 3:  Node 1 --> Node 2
 *
 *  After this iteration, Node 3 has the fully accumulated Segment 0; Node 0
 *  has the fully accumulated Segment 1; and so on. The scatter-reduce is complete.
 *
 *  Next, the allgather distributes these fully accumululated chunks across all nodes.
 *  Communication proceeds in the same ring, once again in N-1 steps. At the ith step,
 *  node j will send chunk (j - i + 1) and receive chunk (j - i). For example, at the
 *  first iteration, the following transfers will occur:
 *
 *      Segment 0:  Node 3 --> Node 0
 *      Segment 1:  Node 0 --> Node 1
 *      Segment 2:  Node 1 --> Node 2
 *      Segment 3:  Node 2 --> Node 3
 *
 * After the first iteration, Node 0 will have a fully accumulated Segment 0
 * (from Node 3) and Segment 1. In the next iteration, Node 0 will send its
 * just-received Segment 0 onward to Node 1, and receive Segment 3 from Node 3.
 * After this has continued for N - 1 iterations, all nodes will have a the fully
 * accumulated tensor.
 *
 * Each node will do (N-1) sends for the scatter-reduce and (N-1) sends for the allgather.
 * Each send will contain K / N bytes, if there are K bytes in the original tensor on every node.
 * Thus, each node sends and receives 2K(N - 1)/N bytes of data, and the performance of the allreduce
 * (assuming no latency in connections) is constrained by the slowest interconnect between the nodes.
